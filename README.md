# Monte_Carlo_PY
This was one of my first monte carlo simulations and thought it would be fun if I visualised it. The idea behind the project is that using the module in python called Turtle it pictures an estimate of the value of PI. It's plain and simple and was really good for an introduction to monte carlo.
